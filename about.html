    <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  Hi! I'm an aspiring web developer with a strong interest in creating clean, user-friendly websites. I recently began my journey in web development and have been exploring the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Every project I build helps me understand the power of the web and fuels my curiosity to learn more.

<p>
  This website is part of my practice — a space where I experiment, improve, and showcase what I’ve learned so far. I'm excited to continue developing my skills and eventually build responsive, dynamic websites that make a difference.
