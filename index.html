   <h1>My Web Dev Journey Day-1</h1> 
   <p>
  My journey into web development began with a spark of curiosity and a desire to create something meaningful on the internet. From writing my first lines of HTML to exploring the endless possibilities of design and interactivity, every step has fueled my passion even more. This page is a reflection of my early learning, experiments, and dedication to building a strong foundation in web development. Iâ€™m excited to continue growing, learning, and turning ideas into reality through code.
